      <h3 class=>I'm a UI designer based in Naples, FL. I have a background in health care and UI design and have been working as a caregiver for the past 3 years. Combining my background in all, I am well equipped with various skills such as conducting research, problem-solving, and creating products with consumers in mind. I love to design and create things. I am interested in building solutions to help solve problems. I am eager to turn great ideas into visually appealing digital products that everyone can use. </h3>
